Abstract: I want to create a library that deals with all the graph related problems. All of the 
problems can be solved by representing a digraph by relations,sets, and graphs. So, to start I will
be translating the above reprs in racket.


Relations: Sets with tuples is enough to represent their counterparts in maths. But we have nothing
for a relation defintion. One needs to understand that a sets with tuples is manifestation of the 
relation. But there is no need of such an abstract thing as we will work with the real tuples.
